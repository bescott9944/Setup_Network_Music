# Setup_Network_Music
Here is the process I used to setup my Linux systems to access my master Music Folder on my Ubuntu Server.
I found this on "Ask Ubuntu" web site and edited for my use:

This process work's for me at the time of this writing:
This is how I setup my network shared Music folder from the server to my "Music" folder in my /home/Music
in Linux..

Please Note that you will have to use ---> What ever your Distro uses to install software <---
These instructions work on Arch, Ubuntu, Debian, Solus, MX, and other Linux Distros I have tested...

This process worked for me on my Linux network at boot time and is automatically loaded and loged
into the network shared folder on the server for my music...

Please note: This setup is "Read Only" from the server. If you want to add files to the folder from your system
you will have to change the file permisions on the server from root I think...
I ssh into my server and upload them that way...

The information is listed as is and in no way guaranteed to work on you setup or network or Linux Installation...
Have fun and enjoy!

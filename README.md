# Setup_Network_Music
Here is the process I used to setup my Linux systems to access my master Music Folder on my Ubuntu Server.
I found this on "Ask Ubuntu" web site and edited for my use:

This process work's for me at the time of this writing:
This is how I setup my network shared Music folder from the server to my "Music" folder in my /home/Music
in Linux..

This process worked for me on my Linux network at boot time and is automatically loaded and loged
into the network shared folder on the server for my music...

Please note: This setup is "Read Only" from the server. If you want to add files to the folder you will
have to change the permisions from root I think...
The information is listed as is and in no way guaranteed to work on you setup or network or Linux Installation...
Have funn and enjoy!
